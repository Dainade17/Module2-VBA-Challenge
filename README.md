# Module2-VBA-Challenge

Overview of Project: The purpose of this project was to go over each stocks year over year and analyze the percentage return and volume of trade and understand which stocks can be a more useful investment


Results: In 2017 DQ had almost 200% return. Followed by ENPH and FSLR with 129% and 101%. Only 1 stock Terp had a negetive return, however in 2018 all stocks produced negetive return except ENPH and RUN. Which means ENPH should be a better choice for investments.
